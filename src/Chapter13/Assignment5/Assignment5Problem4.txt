Assignment 5
Chapter 13, Exercise 4

The mystery1 method will have a complexity of 2N+1.
This is because there are two calls within a for loop which iterates the whole array. This complexity is N(1+1) which is 2N. The assignment of int[] result would be 1. Therefore, the runtime complexity of the mystery 1 method is 2N+1.
